# Tournament DB Interface API in Python
## How to Run

### Initialization
First you must install vagrant or another virtual system to run Postgres or psql.
After you have a virtual machine up and running, log into psql 
type the command and hit enter:
	```psql```
Then type
	```\i tournament.sql```
Which will create the necessary database, views and tables, and log you into the appropriate databse. Type "\q" to exit.

### Running the tests
After you have imported the required database, views, and tables, exit psql and type:
```python tournament_test.py``` to confirm all tests pass.

Finally type ```python tournament_ec_tests.py``` to confirm no rematches occur and that draws can be allowed.

## What this code does
Tournament.py provides an api for deleting, registering, pairing and displaying the results of a tournament match. You can use this code as an interface to retrieve results from a database and implement them into a web application.

### Tournament commands
* deleteMatches() deletes all current matches
* deletePlayers() delete all current players in the tournament
* registerPlayer(name) Adds a player to the tournament database using unique serial id.
* playerStandings() Returns a list of the players and their win records, sorted by wins.
* reportMatch(winner, loser, draw=0) Records the outcome of a single match between two players. Defaults to no draw, but if draw is set to 1, then winner/loser become draw1/draw2 in matches table.
* swissPairings(rematchesAllowed=True) Returns a list of pairs of players for the next round of a match. Rematches can be turned off, they are allowed by default.
